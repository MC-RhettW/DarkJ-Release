# DarkJ

![Preview](https://github.com/Yamazaki93/DarkJ-Release/raw/master/darkj-2.gif "Preview")

Ever feel JIRA's UI is hard to use? Every small action it reloads the whole page or open a brand new one. That list of subtask really doesn't let you do anything. Searching doesn't really work the way you expected and if you find the thing, you don't know how you did it.

Enter DarkJ! A fluid, dark themed native desktop UI for JIRA that helps you get by your daily JIRA workflow easier. With a custom built, Angular based UI, viewing issues has never been easier. A easy-to-use tab system manages all the issues you care about in one convenient place. Live update and pinning issues let you resume work faster and a custom built search page let you search almost everything.  

Interested? How about heading over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Yamazaki93/DarkJ-Release/releases) page and try it out? Oh, and it's free to use by the way.

DarkJ's UI is based on the amazing [Black Dashboard Theme by CreativeTim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/black-dashboard).

**This app is a fan created work and is not an official product of JIRA or endorsed by Atlassian.**

# FAQ

1. Is my JIRA data safe?

    DarkJ stores your JIRA API token with your computer's built-in credential manager, on Windows, it's Credential Manager; on MacOS, it's Keyring. 
    
    Your API token and JIRA login information is only used for authentication purposes and DarkJ will only send your JIRA data and JIRA account information to your organization's JIRA service and not anywhere else.

    To improve your account safety, use a dedicated API token for DarkJ.

2. Is there any keyboard shortcuts?

    Yep, common useful shortcuts are: 

        Ctrl + f = Open Search Page
        Ctrl + n = Open Create Issue Window
        ESC = Exit current window
    
    There are other shortcuts available and they are listed in the menus. For MacOS, replace Ctrl with Command

3. I am getting some timeout warning.

    Try clicking the "Refresh" button on the top-right corner or press "F5" to reload the app

4. I can't transition, create issue or perform some actions.

    Although we try to create controls for most JIRA applications, there might be fields that DarkJ doesn't support and is required to fill in during issue creation or transition.

    In these cases, click the "Open External" button (looks like a square with arrow pointing out) in the related screen and you can perform the actions with JIRA's native UI.
